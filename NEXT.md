# What's next?

So you finished this module and are now convinced that you want to become a web developer. That's great to hear!

In the meantime you can get a head start with the curriculum to increase your chances of completing the course by continuing to learn. Have a look at the following resources that will help build your knowledge and make the next steps a lot easier. There is no particular order in these, see what you enjoy best and remember to code as much as possible yourself!

-   [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) - You can finish off the responsive web design course and get your first certificate!
-   [The JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/) - JavaScript30 is a great set of tutorials that build simple but very interesting frontend applications using HTML/CSS/JavaScript!
-   [30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md) - We have already done some of the days during this module, but it would be good to continue with the 30 Days of JavaScript course!
-   [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Once you feel comfortable with the JavaScript syntax sign up for code wars to practice. It is a website where you can solve exercises and rank up! When signing up, only choose JavaScript to really focus the problems on learning to solve problems in it. You can later change it to other technologies when you get more familiar.

And don't forget that you can even study on the go using the [Mimo app](https://getmimo.com/)!
