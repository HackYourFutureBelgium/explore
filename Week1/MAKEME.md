# Exercises Week 1

## Todo list

1. Web design course
2. CSS challenges
3. Code along
4. Challenges

### **1. Web design course**

FreeCodeCamp is a great learning resource and it has a [free course on Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) that takes you through building bigger webpages in the right way. For this week, try to do the following:

- Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
- Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
- Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers

### **2. CSS Challenges**

In order to improve you need to practice a lot! In the following challenges you'll work with CSS and solve challenges that you may encounter whenever you are building a webpage:

- [CSS Challenges](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges): Solve challenge #1 to #6.

### **3. Code along**

A big part of learning web development is through learning by example. In the following video you'll learn how to build a simple website, using basic HTML & CSS.

> The way to learn best from code alongs is to type out the code yourself while watching. Afterwards, try to add a couple of features to the end result to really have the learnings set in. Have a look at this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-from-coding-tutorials-and-avoid-tutorial-hell/) that explains the pitfalls of using code alongs from the perspective of a learner.

### **4. Challenges**

The following challenges require you to combine your HTML and CSS knowledge to make a webpage. The instructions here are more requirements than a very defined exercise which is closer to what developers do! These are probably too much for one week, but try to do as many of them as you can as each of the numbered challenges are ones we feel add something to your knowledge!
