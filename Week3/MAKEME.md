# Exercises Week 3

Before we learn how to build actual applications, we first need to gain experience using JavaScript in a computational way. This teaches us how to think like a programmer, and gives us more experience with the language itself. This week's practical side is all about doing smaller exercises that will cement your understanding of programming. You could say we are building the foundation.

## Todo list

1. 30 days of JavaScript
2. Exercises

### Note: JS Tutor

Programming is hard and it is going to feel like you don't fully understand what is happening for awhile. The way to try to get a handle on it is to practice, practice, practice. You want to keep experimenting and trying things out.

A good place to practice coding is in the [JS Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) website. You can enter code there and step through it so you can see what is happening behind the scenes. So keep putting code in there and analyse what happens, it will help you understand!

### 1. 30 days of JavaScript

There is an amazing open repository that teaches JavaScript in 30 days. Don't worry, you don't have to do it all this week but you will see us refer to it more often throughout this and next week as well as during the main curriculum. It is a great thing to keep working on in between this module and whenever you get into one of the HYF classes.

- [30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/readMe.md). Do day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

> Note: Day 1 will explain how to install Node.js, Visual Studio Code and how to run code in your browser. These, plus the JS Tutor link above are many different ways of running your code. Find the one you are most comfortable with!

### 2. Exercises

In the following exercises you'll learn how to use different JavaScript concepts to solve common computational problems.

- [Learn-js](https://www.learn-js.org/). Do the following `Learn the basics` exercises:
  - Hello, World!
  - Variables and Types
  - Arrays
  - Manipulating Arrays
  - Operators
  - Conditions
- [Codecademy: Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/learn-javascript-introduction). Do the exercises (#1 to #7).
- [jshero.net](https://www.jshero.net/en/success.html). Do the first 5 exercises.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise_js.asp). Do the JS Variables, JS Operators, JS Data Types, JS Objects, JS Arrays, JS Array Methods and JS Array Sort exercises.

The above should give you a nice basis. If you have extra time and are still a little unsure, have a look at the following:

- [Programiz: JAvascript](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/get-started). This getting started tutorial goes through the basics and provides a lot of examples!
- [FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript). You can choose whichever ones you feel are challenging enough.

## Finished?
